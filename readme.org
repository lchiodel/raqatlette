* Who brings what

Idea: 
- Team Device: Maxime, bring your stuff if you come.
- Team Cheese (Lead: Luce): we need 4 persons taking 4 servings. I'll be part of it to adapt for Maxime's moving plans. Luc and Sami you are in. => 1 missing
- Team Charcuterie: same => 4 missing. We need a team lead! (Francesco?)
- Team Patates: it's heavy I'll take everything on my side => done
- Team Dessert (Lead Emilie): Emilie => i'd say 2 missing 
- Team Drink (Lead: Ulysse?) I counted .5 bottle per person. But I really don't know. In case we miss some, I have some hidden stock of weird stuff.

So others, please find your slot. We should all have something to do / bring.
